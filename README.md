# JavaScript Projects - 20 Days

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Suraj Waghmare, a passionate developer who built these 20 JavaScript projects in 20 days to improve my skills. Below are the links to each of the projects I created using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

These projects cover a wide range of topics and showcase my problem-solving skills and creativity.
